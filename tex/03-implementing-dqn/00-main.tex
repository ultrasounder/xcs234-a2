\section{Implementing DeepMind's DQN}

We are now ready to implement Deep Mind's DQN using Pytorch.

In the following questions, you will implement the deep Q-network as described in \href{https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf}{Human Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning} by implementing \texttt{initialize\_models} and \texttt{get\_q\_values} in \texttt{q3\_dqn\_torch.py}. The rest of the code inherits from what you wrote for linear approximation. 

You will be able to test your implementation locally on the test environment by running:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ python run.py --config_filename=q3_dqn
\end{lstlisting} 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

	\input{03-implementing-dqn/01-initialize-models}

	\input{03-implementing-dqn/02-get-q-values}

	\input{03-implementing-dqn/03-interpretation-of-results}

\end{enumerate}
