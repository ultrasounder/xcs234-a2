\item \points{3c}

Compare the performance of your linear and DQN implementations on the test environment. 

\textbf{Note}: The comparison may not be perfectly fair in this case as both experiments use different configs. 
This comparison should highlight the necessity of finding the right complexity of a model for a given problem.
