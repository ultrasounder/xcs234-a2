Now we're ready to train on the Atari \texttt{Pong} environment. First, launch linear approximation on pong by running the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ python run.py --config_filename=q4_linear
\end{lstlisting} 
This will train the model for $500,000$ steps and should take approximately half an hour. Once training is complete observe the contents of ~results/q4_linear~ and in particular the plot ~scores.png~ (the Azure Guide contains details of moving files from the vm to your local machine). 

Using this plot, describe the performance of your linear model on the \texttt{Pong-v5} environment.
